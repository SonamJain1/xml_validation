#
# The Diameter Watchdog plugin monitors the DIF application
# and will restart the Diameter lockstepped PMD group
# if the percentage of incoming Diameter messages (requests + answers)
# that is transmitted back out of the NIF server drops below
# an acceptable minimum percentage.
#
# The "relayed" percentage is calculated each "DiamWatchdogCheckInterval".
#
# The plugin determines that a Diameter message is inbound if the destination
# IP address in the packet matches one of the configured DifIPAddr(s) and the
# destination SCTP port matches one of the configured DifSctpPort(s).
#
# The plugin determines that a Diameter message is outbound if the source
# IP address in the packet matches one of the configured DifIPAddr(s) and the
# source SCTP port matches one of the configured DifSctpPort(s).
#
# If the incoming traffic rate drops below DiamWatchdogMinIncomingTps then
# the plugin will simply log the stats and will not force a stack bounce, even
# if the "relayed" percentage is too low.

# By default reassembly of Diameter messages over TCP is enabled.
# TcpReassemblyEnabled = true

# When synchronising with Diameter in a TCP stream a list of
# Diameter App Ids can be specified.  If a list is specified then
# a message with an app id in the list must be seen before the
# plugin will consider that it has syncrhonised with the Diameter
# protocol.  If no Diameter app ids are specified then the plugin
# will accept any app id during synchronisation.  Syncrhonisation
# happens when the plugin starts up and following loss of sync due
# to packet truncation or packet loss.
# The App Ids can be specified by name or as a 32-bit unsigned value.
# Supported names are: (S6A, S6D, S13, S9, S6C, SGD)
#
# DiameterAppIdsForTcpAlignment = S6A, S19, S13, 16777236
