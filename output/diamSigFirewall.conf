# TENANTIGNOREDAPPLICATIONIDLIST
#
# Add list of applications id that should not be passed through
# the firewall for each tenant.
#
# TENANTIGNOREDAPPLICATIONIDLIST = Tenant1 : 99999

#
# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTER
#
# Setup application id + command code pairs for which messages

# being handled by the IPS system
#
# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTER = <Tenant Id> : <Application Id> : <Command Code>

# by the IPS system
#
# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTERBYORIGHOST = <Tenant Id> : <Application Id> : <Command Code> : <Orig Host>
#
# For example:
#
# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTERBYORIGHOST = Tenant1 : 16777251 : 316 : mmecD2.mmegi8800.mme.epc.mnc001.mcc460.3gppnetwork.org

# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTERBYORIGREALM

# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTERBYORIGREALM = Tenant1 : 16777251 : 317 : epc.mnc001.mcc460.3gppnetwork.org

#
# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTERBYDESTREALM
#
# Setup application id + command code + destination realm triplets for which messages
# should not be sent to the firewall service as they are currently being handled
# by the IPS system
#
# TENANTACTIVEMSGFILTERBYDESTREALM = <Tenant Id> : <Application Id> : <Command Code> : <Dest Realm>
#
# For example:
#

# By default reassembly of Diameter messages over TCP is enabled.
# TcpReassemblyEnabled = true

# When synchronising with Diameter in a TCP stream a list of
# Diameter App Ids can be specified.  If a list is specified then
# a message with an app id in the list must be seen before the
# plugin will consider that it has syncrhonised with the Diameter
# protocol.  If no Diameter app ids are specified then the plugin
# will accept any app id during synchronisation.  Syncrhonisation
# happens when the plugin starts up and following loss of sync due
# to packet truncation or packet loss.
# The App Ids can be specified by name or as a 32-bit unsigned value.
# Supported names are: (S6A, S6D, S13, S9, S6C, SGD)
#
# DiameterAppIdsForTcpAlignment = S6A, S19, S13, 16777236
