# We can configure the passive monitor to calcalate session keys (used to correlated TC-BEGINs, TC-CONTINUEs, TC-ENDs and TC-ABORTs)
# in a number of ways.  By default we hash the SCCP Cg digits and the oTid
#                                 and hash the SCCP Cd digits and the dTid
# This does not work with roaming hubs that mangling the digits in the SCCP addresses.  Thus we have other options:
#
#       ROAMINGHUBAWARE
#       SSNANDTID
#       TIDONLY
#
# Given we are typically analysing dialogues between many signalling end points the chance of incorrect session key collision
# increases as we go from: SCCPHASHANDTID to SSNANDTID to TIDONLY.
#
# SessionKey calculation policies.
# SESSIONKEYPOLICY = SCCPHASHANDTID
#
# If SESSIONKEYPOLICY is set to ROAMINGHUBAWARE then the SCCP cd in the TC-BEGIN is checked against the configured roaming hub prefixes.
# If there is a match the fallback session key calculation policy is used.
