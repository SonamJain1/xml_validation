# By default reassembly of Diameter messages over TCP is enabled.
# TcpReassemblyEnabled = true

# When synchronising with Diameter in a TCP stream a list of
# Diameter App Ids can be specified.  If a list is specified then
# a message with an app id in the list must be seen before the
# plugin will consider that it has syncrhonised with the Diameter
# protocol.  If no Diameter app ids are specified then the plugin
# will accept any app id during synchronisation.  Syncrhonisation
# happens when the plugin starts up and following loss of sync due
# to packet truncation or packet loss.
# The App Ids can be specified by name or as a 32-bit unsigned value.
# Supported names are: (S6A, S6D, S13, S9, S6C, SGD)
#
# DiameterAppIdsForTcpAlignment = S6A, S19, S13, 16777236

# LD HA Groups
# We share HA related information over EWOK.
# 
# Two things are shared:
#
# HAGroupName - the name of the group
#               all members of the same
#               group negotiate to find
#               a single active member.
# HAGroupScore - a value indicating how
#                much service a given
#                member of the group can
#                provide.  The member
#                with the highest score
#                will be the active member.
#                Where there is a tie.
#                Then the member with
#                the highest score and
#                lowest EWOK NodeId
#                will be the active member.
#
#                Currently the HAGroupScore
#                calculation is hard coded
#                and is calculated as follows:
#
#                (trafficPresent * 100,000) +
#         (numMonitorNicsWithLinks * 1,000) +
#                (isPreferredNode *      1)
#
# eg.
#
# a NIF with two monitored NICs that's seeing traffic
# will have a score of 102,000
#
# a NIF with a single monitored NIC that is configured
# as the preferred node and is seeing traffic will
# have a score of 101,001
#
# The HA information can be viewed from within eccm.

# The group name defaults to an empty string.
# An empty string group name disables this
# HA functionality.
#
# LdHAGroupName = TheHAGroup

# The HA information is shared by every loaddirector
# that this client is connected to.
# If we receive an HA report from one LD then
# we expect an HA report from the remaining LDs
# The timeout governs how long we are prepared to
# wait for those remaining HA reports.
# 3 seconds is the default.
#
# LdHAGroupFailoverTimeout = 3secs

# Set this option to true to bump the HAScore
# of this node up by one so that it will always
# be active if all other HA factors are equal.
#
# LdHAGroupPreferredNode = false
